                <p>
                  Hi there! I’m Nhlalo Nkos, an aspiring full sta developer with a
                  big love for front-end development. My curiosity about how
                  websites are structured and what makes some of them load faster
                  than others has sparked an exciting journey into the world of web
                  development. I find it fascinating to dive into the nitty-gritty
                  of the internet and discover how everything works together. I’m
                  particularly passionate about providing accessibility to people
                  with current limitations, ensuring that everyone, regardless of
                  their abilities, can enjoy and navigate the web seamlessly. Every
                  day is a new adventure as I learn to create beautiful and
                  efficient web applications, and I can’t wait to see where this
                  path takes me!
